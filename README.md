# nims
 Python script for the game of Nim
This script implements a simple version of the game of Nim. Players take turns removing stones from piles, with the goal of taking the last stone. The number of piles and stones in each pile is randomly generated at the beginning of the game. Players can input their moves by choosing a pile and specifying the number of stones to remove. The game continues until all piles are empty, and the player who takes the last stone wins.
